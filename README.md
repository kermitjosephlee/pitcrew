# PitCrew

PitCrew is designed to help you call for help to the people who can help you.


## Motivation

Inspired by volunteering as a bike technician on charity bike rides, charity riders who needed help were not able to articulate where they are to the people who could help them. They would carry phones that had all the tools within them to communicate all the information necessary to get help to them, but there was no app that closed this gap. PitCrew was designed to fill that gap.

## How It Works

PitCrew starts with a rider looking for help. The rider gives their name and mobile number. PitCrew then queries the rider for the type of help needed: mechanical help (ie. flat tire), medical help (ie. scrapes), and sweep (ie. too tired to continue). PitCrew will then take this information along with their geolocation and send that to a central dispatch./
